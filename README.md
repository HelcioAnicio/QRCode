## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties

- Responsiveness


### What I learned

I decided to practice my skills and create this page as fast as I could.

```CSS
body, html {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    height:100vh;
    width: 100vw;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

### Continued development

i'll create pages with JS and flexgrid, i didn't use flexgrid yet.
